# About me!
I'm Nicola Canzonieri and I'm a computer science student at Udine, in Italy.

## A little bit of story...

### The foundations

In 2020, I established Sliced Games Studios, a moniker under which I realized videogames using Unity Engine.

In 2021 I released my first ever game: [Star Legacy](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/star-legacy) for Android.

In the same year I finished 7th in the 15th ScoreSpace Game Jam with [Star Rescue](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/star-rescue).

In 2022 I announced the Five Nights at Freddy's Fan game: Under The Blankets. However first gameplay have been shown on [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/p/under-the-blankets-first-devlog-game-page-open-rshpkdnk) only in 2023. To date this game represent 4 years of game production experience in Unity.

Under the Blankets is also the combination of all my capacities in: game development, music and soundtrack, 3D and 2D graphics. In fact the game is entirely made by me, from the top to bottom.

In 2023 I released the Under The Blankets prequel: [Under The Blankets Arcade](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/the-inventor) on [Itch.io](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/).

### Change of direction...

While my passion for gaming remains, in 2024 I've discovered a new calling in general-purpose software development. In particular this new projects are focused on a better lifestyle and mental health. Part of this transition are Aura for Android and Lucid for the web. Because of this change of direction I renamed Sliced Games Studios in Halo Productions

### Other projects and opportunities

During my highschool period I worked on various space and astronomy based simulations with Unity.

In 2023 I joined the UNIUD E-Racing Team, the Formula SAE team of the University of Udine. During the first year I helped the team create an updated user interface for a telemetry software. Joining the team is probably the greatest opportunity I have had in my career because I combined my passion for software development with the Motorsport culture, which is another great passion of mine.
