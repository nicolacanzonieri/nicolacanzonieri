In 2020, I established Sliced Games Studios, a moniker under which I realized videogames using Unity Engine. In 2021 I released my first ever game: [Star Legacy](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/star-legacy) for Android. In the same year I finished 7th in the 15th ScoreSpace Game Jam with [Star Rescue](https://sliced-games-studios.itch.io/star-rescue).

In 2022 I announced the Five Nights at Freddy's Fan game: Under The Blankets. However first gameplay have been shown on [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/p/under-the-blankets-first-devlog-game-page-open-rshpkdnk) only in 2023. This game represent 4 years of game production experience in Unity.
