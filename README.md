## About Me:

I'm Nicola Canzonieri, a computer science student at the University of Udine. 

I'm passionate about computer science, software programming, and video games. I also love music and motorsport in general.
In my free time, I like to work on projects, such as video games or other software, or just listen to music. 

I love challenges, but if something doesn't make sense to me or I don't understand it, you can rest assured that sooner or later I'll figure it out the problem.

Here are some of my skills and interests:

* Programming languages: I'm proficient in C#, C++, Java, and Python. I'm also learning JavaScript and Rust.
* Software development: I have experience with a variety of software development methodologies.
* Videogames: I'm an avid gamer and I've developed a few small games of my own.
* Music: I play the piano sometimes and I love listening to all kinds of music.
* Motorsport: I'm a big fan of Formula 1 and WEC and I'm always excited to watch the races.


I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you have any projects or ideas that you think I might be interested in, please don't hesitate to reach out.
